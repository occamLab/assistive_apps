<h1>Using Clew</h1>
  <h2>App Features</h2>
    <h3>Current Version</h3>
      <p>Clew allows you to record a route using your phone and then follow that route in reverse to your starting location.  Clew's capabilities are based on two primary use cases.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>When navigating with a sighted guide, you may wish to return to your previous location independently.  If you have not fully learned the route yet, Clew can help you to more confidently navigate the route.</li>
	  <li>Sometimes it is easier to navigate from point A to point B than point B to point A.  As an example, it may be easier to navigate from your seat at a table in a conference room to the bathroom than it would be to navigate from the bathroom back to your specific seat.  Clew can help with the return journey.</li>
	</ol>
     <p>In addition to allowing you to record and then navigate back along a route, Clew also allows you to pause the app so that you can navigate back at a later time.  More details on the pause feature are given below.</p>
    <h3>Future Versions</h3>
	<p>Among other great suggestions, we have heard feedback from quite a few users that they would like to be able to save routes so that they can navigate them at a later time.  We are actively working on this feature.  Another feature we are working on is the ability to share routes with other users.</p> 
  <h2>How well does Clew work?</h2>
<p>Clew relies on the position tracking technology provided by Apple's ARKit.  These motion estimates are based on tracking elements in the environment visually (using your phone's camera) and on motion estimates from special sensors in your phone.  While this technology is incredibly advanced, it does not work perfectly.  You should expect that over very long routes, particular ones with limited visual features or poor lighting, that the accuracy of the tracking (and hence the app's guidance) will decrease.  As such, you should always use your orientation and mobility skills to ensure your personal safety when using Clew.  We are working on additional strategies for improving the accuracy of Clew.</p>
  <h2>Recording a route</h2>
<p>As soon as the app launches, the app will present the record route button.  Once you activate this control, you can begin to move along the route you'd like to record.
    <h3>Properly positioning your phone when using Clew</h3>
<p>The app's motion estimates are based primarily on analyzing images from your phone's camera.  The app will not work unless your phone's rear camera is capturing images of your environment.  The app will not work if the phone is in your pocket or if any part of your body is blocking your phone's rear camera.  We have found that the app works best when you hold the phone in portrait orientation with the rear camera facing directly ahead of you and the phone oriented vertically.  Other orientations can work, but may result in diminished accuracy.</p>
<h2>Stopping a recording</h2>
<p>When you've finished the route, you can use the stop button to stop the recording.  At this point, you can either immediately navigate back to the starting location or else pause the app so you can navigate at a later time.</p>
<h2>Pausing a route</h2>
<p>In order to pause the app, you must place the phone in a position such that you can reliably return the phone to that same position when resuming the app.  It is not crucial that you position the phone in exactly the same place (although the more accurately you can do this, the better the app will work), however, you must be able to place the phone in the same orientation.  To make it easy to return the phone to the same orientation, we recommend pressing the screen of your phone against a vertical surface (like a wall) before pausing (instructions will be provided in the app when you activate the pause feature).  We are working on an improved pause feature, so please stay tuned for this in a future update.</p>
<h2>Resuming a route</h2>
<p>Assuming you paused your route, you can resume it by following the instructions provided by the app.  The app will prompt you to return the phone to the location where you paused it.</p>
<h2>Following a route back to your starting location</h2>
<p>Once you activate the start navigation feature, the app will provide you with instructions to navigate back to your starting location.  The app provides feedback in the following formats.</p>
    <h3>Haptic feedback</h3>
      <p>Assuming you have enabled haptic feedback in the app settings and you have an iPhone that supports haptics (iPhone 7 or later should work), the phone will provide haptic vibration when it is facing in the correct direction of travel for the route.  It is important to keep in mind that this feedback is relative to the direction of the phone, rather than your body.  When you achieve a milestone in the route (we call these waypoints), you will feel a stronger haptic vibration.</p>
    <h3>Auditory beeps</h3>
      <p>Assuming you have enabled sound feedback in the app settings and your iphone doesn't have system sounds muted, the phone will make a beeping sound when it is facing in the correct direction of travel for the route.  It is important to keep in mind that this feedback is relative to the direction of the phone, rather than your body.  When you achieve a milestone in the route (we call these waypoints), you will hear a different sound effect.</p>
    </h3>
    <h3>Speech feedback</h3>
      <p>
	 Assuming you have enabled speech feedback in the app settings and voice over is on, the phone will provide you with voice directions whenever you encounter a waypoint on your route, start a route, or complete a route.  If you want to hear voice directions again, you can use the &quot;Get Directions&quot; button.</p>
      </p>
    </h3>
  <h2>Rating your navigation experience</h2>
    <p>Once you are done navigating, assuming you have enabled the &quot;Send Logs&quot; setting, the app will ask you to rate your service.  These ratings help us improve the app experience and the app's accuracy.  Along with your rating, your phone's path will be sent in the log.  Please note that this data is not linked to you in any way and it does not contain any information about the location where the path was recorded (e.g., no GPS coordinates are logged).  Further, no images or other sensitive information are logged by the app.  If you have any concerns about the data in the logs, please contact us (or simply switch off the &quot;Send Logs&quot; feature in the app settings).</p>
<h2>Providing feedback to the development team</h2>
<p>Please send any and all feedback to the development team at clewapp@gmail.com.  We take your feedback seriously and will do our best to act on it.</p>
